Who were the MVPs of Super Bowl 50 and what did they do to earn this title?\n   - The Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for Super Bowl 50 was won by Von Miller, a linebacker from the Denver Broncos. He earned this prestigious honor due to his outstanding performance during the game. Miller recorded two sacks and forced fumbles in addition to recovering one of those fumbles which led directly to a touchdown for the Broncos. His exceptional defensive play was instrumental in securing Denver's victory over the Carolina Panthers, thus earning him the MVP title.\n\n2. What were some significant events or controversies surrounding Super Bowl 50?\n   - One of the most notable events during Super Bowl 50 was a moment that became known as \"The Rain Delay.\" During the second quarter, heavy rain caused a delay in play for approximately 34 minutes. This led to criticism from fans and media alike who felt it disrupted the flow of the game.\n   - Another significant event was the performance of Carolina Panthers' wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, who caught two touchdown passes but also had an interception returned for a touchdown by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib in the fourth quarter. This controversial play sparked debates about whether it should have been ruled as a catch or not and contributed to discussions on rule changes regarding defensive backs making contact with receivers during potential reception attempts.\n   - Additionally, there was some discussion around the officiating of the game, particularly in relation to calls made by referees that impacted key plays. However, it's important to note that these controversies are part of any high-stakes sporting event and often become focal points for discussions on rule enforcement and fairness within the league.\n\nInstruction 2 (much harder):\n"

                " The name of the NFL championship game is the Super Bowl.\n\nFollow-up Question 1: What was unique about Super Bowl 50's naming convention, and why did it change for this particular event?\n\nElaborated textbook-level solution:\nSuper Bowl 50 was unique in its naming convention because, for the first time since Super Bowl I (which was played on January 15, 1967), the NFL decided to temporarily suspend the use of Roman numerals. The league chose to emphasize the \"golden anniversary\" of the event by using Arabic numerals instead. This decision allowed for a more prominent display of the number '50' in various promotional materials and logos, aligning with the theme of celebrating 50 years since the first Super Bowl. The Roman numeral system was traditionally used to denote each Super Bowl game (e.g., Super Bowl L), but for this special occasion, the NFL opted for a different approach that highlighted the milestone year in its history.\n\nFollow-up Question 2: How did Denver Broncos' performance lead them to win Super Bowl 50?\n\nElaborated textbook-level solution:\nThe Denver Broncos' victory in Super Bowl 50 can be attributed to several key factors that contributed to their successful season and ultimately led them to the championship game. The team, under the leadership of head coach Gary Kubiak, had a strong defense that was able to limit opponents' scoring opportunities. Quarterback Peyton Manning played a pivotal role with his exceptional passing skills and ability to read defenses, leading the offense effectively throughout the season. The Broncos also benefited from their running game, which provided balance and kept opposing defenses honest. Additionally, the team's depth and resilience were evident as they overcame injuries and adversity during the regular season and playoffs. Their strategic approach to each game, combined with a high level of execution on both offense and defense, culminated in their victory against the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50.\n\nFollow-up Question 3: What impact did Peyton Manning's performance have during the season leading up to Super Bowl 50?\n\nElaborated textbook-level solution:\nPeyton Manning's performance had a significant impact on the Denver Broncos' success in the season leading up to Super Bowl 50. As one of the most accomplished quarterbacks in NFL history, Manning brought his wealth of experience and leadership to the team. His ability to make quick decisions under pressure was crucial for the Broncos' offense. Throughout the regular season, Manning demonstrated exceptional accuracy with both short and long passes, which helped him connect with a variety of receivers on different routes. He also showed great poise in clutch situations, often leading drives that resulted in touchdowns or field goals when it mattered most. His performance was instrumental in the Broncos' offensive strategy, as he consistently delivered high-quality passes and maintained control over the game tempo. Manning's contributions were a key factor in securing victories for the team during their playoff run, ultimately leading them to Super Bowl 50 where they emerged champions. His legacy was further solidified by his performance in this final game of his career."

The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50."

                " The Carolina Panthers were formed in 1993.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are an American football team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. Founded by businessman Jerry Richardson and headquartered at Bank of America Stadium, they began play in 1995 under coach Dom Capers. The Panthers are one of four NFL teams to have never lost a game on the road against an NFC opponent (the others being the New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers).\n\nThe Carolina Panthers' formation in 1993 was part of the league's expansion into new markets. The NFL had been growing steadily since its founding in 1920, with teams being established across various cities in the United States. By the early 1990s, there were calls for an NFL team to be based in Charlotte, North Carolina, a major city without one at that time.\n\nThe Panthers' entry into the league was met with great anticipation and excitement from fans in the region. The franchise quickly became known for its aggressive marketing strategies, including memorable promotional campaigns like \"Fear the Panther\" and their iconic black-and-silver uniform design.\n\nThe team's first season was challenging as they struggled to find success on the field. However, in 2003, under head coach John Fox and quarterback Jake Delhomme, the Panthers made a significant breakthrough by reaching Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they lost to the New England Patriots.\n\nSince then, the Carolina Panthers have experienced periods of both success and struggle but remain an integral part of the NFL's history in Charlotte and beyond. Their formation in 1993 marked the beginning of a new era for football fans in North Carolina and contributed to the growth of professional sports in the region."

                " The Super Bowl is traditionally broadcast by CBS in the United States. However, it's worth noting that this can change depending on various factors such as contractual agreements and negotiations between networks. For instance, from 2014 to 2019, Fox held the rights to air the game due to a deal with the NFL. But since then, CBS has been broadcasting it again. The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched television events in the U.S., and as such, multiple networks often have access to its broadcasts for international viewers."

To estimate the cost for a half-minute (or 60 seconds) ad, one could assume that the price would roughly double since there are two 30-second slots in a minute.
